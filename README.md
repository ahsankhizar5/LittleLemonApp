## What’s Inside? 📂

Just the good stuff:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file in `public/`.
- `src/App.js`: The heart of the React app with all the components.
- `src/App.css`: Custom styles for that clean, modern look.
- `package.json`: Dependencies and scripts to keep things smooth.
- `.gitignore`: Keeps `node_modules` and junk out.
- `readmeAssets/`: Holds images like wireframes, UI designs, and screenshots.
- `README.md`: This awesome guide you’re reading!

## Tools I Used 🛠️

- **ReactJS**: For building dynamic, reusable components.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Powers the logic and state management.
- **CSS3**: Styles everything with a responsive grid and sleek design.
- **Figma**: For wireframing and crafting the UI design.
- **Create React App**: Sets up the project with zero hassle.
- **Node.js/NPM**: Manages dependencies and runs the app.
